**Date**: 2026-01-25

**Status**: Complete - No research required

## Summary

No NEEDS CLARIFICATION markers were identified in the technical context or feature specification. All implementation details are well-established through existing codebase patterns and akshare API documentation.

## Decisions Made

- **Backend APIs**: Use existing FastAPI/FastAPI router patterns with async endpoints
- **Frontend Components**: Follow existing React/TypeScript patterns with Tailwind CSS styling
- **Data Fetching**: Use existing apiClient service for backend communication
- **UI Patterns**: Follow existing table display patterns with dark mode support
- **Navigation**: Extend existing sidebar navigation pattern in StockMarketOverviewPage

## Alternatives Considered

None - all implementation approaches are dictated by existing architecture and API contracts.

## Conclusion
